Question: What is Mutable String in java With suitable Example?
Answer:   In Java, Strings are immutable. This means that once a String object is created, 
          it cannot be modified. However, Java provides two classes that can  be used to 
          create mutable strings: StringBuffer and StringBuilder. Both classes provide methods 
          for modifying the contents of the string they represent. 

	Here's an example of how to create a mutable string using StringBuffer:


		StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
		sb.append(" World");
		System.out.println(sb);
